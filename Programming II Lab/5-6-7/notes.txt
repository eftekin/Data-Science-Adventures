The Wretched of the Earth (French: Les Damn√©s de la Terre) is a 1961 
book by the philosopher Frantz Fanon, in which the author provides a
psychoanalysis of the dehumanizing effects of colonization upon the 
individual and the nation, and discusses the broader social, cultural, 
and political implications of establishing a social movement for the 
decolonization of a person and of a people. The French-language title 
derives from the opening lyrics of "The Internationale".
