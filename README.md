# Python Practices

This is a GitHub repository that I created to track my progress and share my development while learning the Python programming language. In this project, I aim to learn the fundamental concepts, syntax, and best practices of Python. This repository serves as a resource for improving my Python skills through code examples, documentation, and notes.

## Getting Started

If you are new to learning Python, the following resources can help you get started:

- [Official Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/): The official documentation of Python provides comprehensive explanations of all aspects of the Python language.
- [Python.org](https://www.python.org/): The official website of Python programming language, which includes up-to-date news, documentation, and more.
- [Python Tutorials](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html): The official Python tutorials that teach Python from scratch.
- [Learn Python](https://www.learnpython.org/): An interactive online learning platform that teaches Python programming language through interactive lessons.
- [Codecademy - Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3): An online learning platform that teaches Python through interactive lessons.
